In other words, strong AI systems have a general and flexible intelligence that allows them to adapt to and learn new tasks, rather than being specifically designed for a single task or set of tasks. Weak AI, also known as artificial narrow intelligence, refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed for a specific task or set of tasks. These systems are not capable of adapting to new tasks or learning new skills. They are often designed to perform a specific function, such as recognizing faces in images or playing a game like chess.

In unsupervised machine learning, the training data includes only input features and no labeled output values.
